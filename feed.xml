    The building industry is one of the biggest producers of rubbish, including toxic materials like glues, paints stains and primers, treated timbers, insulation materials, carpets and much more. These are not only toxic for the environment, but also for our health. Considering how much time we spent in our homes, we are breathing in toxic off-gassing or potentially exposing ourselves to toxic materials whenever we do repainting or renovations.&nbsp;
